We spent quite a bit of time working on this project. We decided to create a coffee/personality quiz because one of us loves coffee and the other doesn't drink it but likes the coffee vibe.

We spent the first few days planning out our code on paper because we agreed that the largest problems we run into with the assesments and exercises is just beginning coding without
planning or thought. Once we wrote out our pseudocode on paper, we began coding.

We started by coming up with our personality questions and storing them in 'questions.'
Then we initialized our score array of zeros. Then we established our coffee types and recipes to print in the terminal. 
This was the simpler part, we then tried to prompt our questions and then tally our score which proved difficult. We struggled a bit with how to prompt our questions but used  YouTube
and MatLab resources to figre this part out. The most difficult part was assigning our results to the scores. It took a a couple days and hours of debugging, but we figured out how to 
create a loop that checks each score with the score boundaries we established. We had lower scores as calmer/tamer personalities (vanilla iced coffee) and higher scores as more wild 
personalities (iced lavender latte). We created our recipe and personality results and put them in jpeg form and prompted that they show up once the user finished the quiz. 

Another issue we had was with image paths. We previosuly only showed images on canvas and when we tried to do it on the desktop it was really difficult to figure out how to allow 
Matlab to access desktop files, etc. But we figured it out! :) 

We went in and added the music later as a last minute embellishment. We read the Matlab information on how to insert an audio and start/stop it, and we downloaded the sound from a 
sketchy website. 

We think what worked well for this project was planning it out on paper first because this made it a lot more clear how we were going to proceed. However, we should have spent more time
planning and been more specific because we ran into major issues with our loops that took days to figure out. We also had a lot of fun with this project because matching personalities
to coffee types was entertaining. 

Overall, super fun! Sydney is an iced lavender latte and Zach is an espresso macchiato :)

Love,
Sydney and Zach
